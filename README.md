# DSS Community Site

Since the beginning of the Data Science Specialization we've noticed the unbelievable passion students have about our courses and the generosity they show toward each other on the course forums. A couple students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students. This site is meant to serve as a central directory for community created content.

## Contributing

If you've created a web page, video, sideshow, or any other kind of media you think should be shared through this directory you should:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a link to your content on the appropriate course page.
3. Commit your changes. 
4. Submit a pull request.

We've created a [sample pull request](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/DataScienceSpecialization.github.io/pull/1) to show you what we would like to see in a pull request. If we think your creation is well made, informative, and adds something new to this repository of content then we'll merge your request and add you to our list of contributors. If you happen to notice any inaccuracies or idiosyncrasies on this site or in this site's content, please let us know by opening an issue.

Before sending a pull request to this site you should ask yourself:

1. Am I the creator of the content I'm submitting?
2. Does my contribution teach?
3. Does the content of my contribution clearly address topics in the Data Science Specialization?
4. Could my contribution be seamlessly integrated into the canonical course materials?

If the answer to any of these questions in no then you probably shouldn't send a pull request. If you're on the fence about #3 or #4, err on the side of sending a pull request!
